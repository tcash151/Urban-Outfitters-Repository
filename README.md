# Urban-Outfitters-Repository
I know this was difficult for not only me, but you as well Dr. Awwal, because I waited till the last moments to do what needed to be done. A lot was happeneing this
month, so please forgive me for that. I changed a lot from the original design, it was plain and boring at first, now it is a little better, added some color
and a background. All the suggestions that my peer reviewer gave me I used and changed. I think that the users are the people we need to be listening to anyways. I know
that something is off about how I was uploading this stuff to this github thing, so forgive me for that, but I really did try hard ecspecially with the short amount of 
time I had left.
